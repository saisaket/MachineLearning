Machine Learning Algorithms
The project2 folder consists of code and datasets for the Machine Learning Algorithms Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and Linear Regression. They perform regression and Classification on the images based on features derived from them.

The project3 folder consists of code and datasets to perform classification on MNIST and USPS dataset of numbers. Softmax Regression, SVM, Random Forest and Neural Networks are used for classification. Hard Voting (majority voting) is used for ensemble.
